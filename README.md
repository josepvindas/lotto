Lotto is a simple [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app developed using the [Expo](https://expo.io/) libraries, with a [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) backend.

The idea behind the application is to create a platform where users can place bets on the local lottery games and be notified of prizes.

## Usage

### Back-end

The Strapi Server requires authentication in order to serve information. This means that the only proper way to interact with it is through the application. However, [this link](http://lotto-back.herokuapp.com/games) has been made publicly accessible so you can get an idea of the data structure.

### Front-End

To run the application all you need is to install the [Expo App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en) on your Android Smartphone and add [this project](https://expo.io/@josepvindas/lotto) to your list of apps. Alternatively, you can simply select the `Scan QR Code` option and scan this code.

> **Important:** Due to Apple's security regulations, iOS users can't access published expo projects unless they are submitted to the Apple Store as well, which is why only Android users can test-run this application.
